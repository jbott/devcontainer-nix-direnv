# Load a Nix Flake dev shell via VSCode Dev Container

This is a simple example of configuring VSCode to run a container that loads a
Nix Flake dev shell automatically.

This enables non-nix users to get started with a flakes-enabled repo quickly,
without needing to install nix on their host computer (although they should ðŸ˜‰).
